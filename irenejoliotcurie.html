  <h3> Nobel Prize Winner 1935</h3>
  <p>Irene was born in paris in 1897 to Henry and Marie Curie.</p>
  <p>Unsatisfied with the quality of the loal education, her mother and Paul Langevin formed a cooperative where 9 scholars taught each other's children.</p>
  <p>She went on to work as a nurse during the first world war and completed her education at the Radium Institute, founded by her parents.</p>
  <p>At the end her PhD she was asked to teach some lab skills to Frederic Joliot, whom she later wed taking on the name Irene Joliot-Curie. Presumably, this was less of a problem with HR back in the day. </p>
  <p>Irene and her husband were awarded the 1935 Nobel prize for their discovery of beta emission, the process by which an unstable radioactive isotope is formed by a stable isotope losing a positron.</p>
  <p>They also participated in the creation of the first French nuclear reactor in 1948.</p>
  <p>She died in 1956 from leukemia, believed to have been caused by radioactive exposure.</p>
