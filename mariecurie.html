  <h3> Nobel Prize Winner 1911</h3>
  <p>Marie Curie is perhaps the most famous female scientist of all time. Born in Poland, she moved to France in 1891 to study maths, physics and chemistry at the University of Paris.</p>
  <p>She was awarded a physics Nobel prize in 1903 alongside her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel for their work on the radiation phenomena.</p>
  <p>This prize was originally only going to be awarded to the men, but a member of the board told Pierre Curie this and he complained, afterwhich, Marie's name was added to the nomination.</p>
  <p>She then became the first person to be awarded two Nobel prizes, when she was awarded the chemistry Nobel prize in 1911 for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. She remains to this day the only woman to have been awarded two Nobel prizes.</p>
  <p>Marie Curie also defined the international standard for radioactive emissions, still used today, the curie.</p>
  <p>She died in 1934 from radiation poisoning, one year before her daughter would also be awarded the chemistry Nobel prize. The ill effects of radiation exposure were not known at the time she conducted her work.</p>
  <p>In 1944, the element Curium was discovered at Berkley and named after Marie and her husband for their controbutions to radioactive chemistry.</p>
