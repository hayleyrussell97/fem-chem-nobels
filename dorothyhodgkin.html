  <h3> Nobel Prize Winner 1964</h3>
  <p>Dorothy was born in 1910 to English parents in Cairo.</p>
  <p>She attended a grammar school in Suffolk where she was one of two girls allowed to study chemistry.</p>
  <p>She studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, graduating in 1932 and moving to Cambridge for her doctorate at Newnham College.</p>
  <p>She later returned to Oxford and began her independent academic career researching x-ray crystallography.</p>
  <p>She was awarded the Nobel prize in 1964 for her discovery of the structure of vitamin B12 and remains to this day, the only British female scientist to be awarded a Nobel prize.</p>
